What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git folder created - no commits.
git needs to track some metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It's different in the sense that's literaly not the same thing (lol).
The working directory is just the folder of the repository.
The repository is a folder + .git metadata.
The staging area is where we tell git which files to track changes.
It's nice because we don't want to track ALL files in a ceratin working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

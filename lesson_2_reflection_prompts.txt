What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git folder created - no commits.
git needs to track some metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It's different in the sense that's literaly not the same thing (lol).
The working directory is just the folder of the repository.
The repository is a folder + .git metadata.
The staging area is where we tell git which files to track changes.
It's nice because we don't want to track ALL files in a ceratin working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
The answer is in the question... You stage only files with changes relevant to that logical change.
Only problem is when a single file contains more than a single logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
When we want to try out new features that might not work.
When we want to refractor our code.
When we want to split to multiple independent projects that should be merged later on.
Branches allow us to keep work independent from one another.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It conveys very easily the state of the repository, see which branches have which commits, where they branch off and so on.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
A new commit is created, it has 2 parents: the 2 tips of the branches.
Well, cuz, they are merged, we can see in that in the diagram? i don't get the why question.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

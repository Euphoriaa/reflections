Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

As we've learned, we want to make commits about single logical changes to a project.
Often these logical changes take form in changes accross multiple files!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log to find commits ; diff to see the actual differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well, obviously it would make you a-lot more confident, since you can "always" go back before you broke stuff.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Work, personal projects, hw, anything that goes undergoes changes.
